	abstract = {The expansion of the Internet and the number of its users has raised many new problems in information retrieval. The most common way to find information in the web is using web search engines. However, gathering information from the web is a difficult task for a novice user even if he uses the search engines. The user must have experience and skill to find the relevant pages from the large number of documents returned, which often cover a wide variety of topics. One solution to the problem is to build a domain-specific search system that returns only web documents relevant to a certain domain. In this thesis, we adopt query refinement approach when we build domain specific search systems. This approach is based on the idea that the main difficulty in searching the web is result from the fact that users cannot formulate appropriate queries representing their information needs. We try to support users by changing their queries to appropriate forms. In this thesis, we present following issues on domain-specific web search. 1. A simple and domain-independent method for building domainspecific web search engines. Previous domain-specific web search engines are based on human knowledge about the domain in question. Accordingly, they are hard to build and cannot be applied to other domains. We contrive a new method that improves search performance by adding the domainspecific},

As a step towards interconnecting the Web of Documents with the Web of Data, we developed DBpedia Spotlight, a system for automatically annotating text documents with DBpedia URIs. DBpedia Spotlight allows users to configure the annotations to their specific needs through the DBpedia Ontology and quality measures such as prominence, topical pertinence, contextual ambiguity and disambiguation confidence. We compare our approach with the state of the art in disambiguation, and evaluate our results in light of three baselines and six publicly available annotation systems, demonstrating the competitiveness of our system. DBpedia Spotlight is shared as open source and deployed as a Web Service freely available for public use.}

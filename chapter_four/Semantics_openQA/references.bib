  abstract = {The architectural choices underlying Linked Data have led to a compendium  of data sources which contain both duplicated and fragmented information  on a large number of domains. One way to enable non-experts users  to access this data compendium is to provide keyword search frameworks  that can capitalize on the inherent characteristics of Linked Data.  Developing such systems is challenging for three main reasons. First,  resources across different datasets or even within the same dataset  can be homonyms. Second, different datasets employ heterogeneous  schemas and each one may only contain a part of the answer for a  certain user query. Finally, constructing a federated formal query  from keywords across different datasets requires exploiting links  between the different datasets on both the schema and instance levels.  We present Sina, a scalable keyword search system that can answer  user queries by transforming user-supplied keywords or natural-languages  queries into conjunctive SPARQL queries over a set of interlinked  data sources. Sina uses a hidden Markov model to determine the most  suitable resources for a user-supplied query from different datasets.  Moreover, our framework is able to construct federated queries by  us- ing the disambiguated resources and leveraging the linking structure  underlying the datasets to query. We evaluate Sina over three different  datasets. Sina can answer 25 queries from the QALD-1 correctly; furthermore,  it performs as well as the best system from the QALD-3 competition  by answering 32 questions correctly. More importantly, it is capable  of answering queries on interlinked distributed sources. Moreover,  we study the runtime of SINA in its sequential as well as parallel  implementations and draw conclusions on the scalability of keyword  search on Linked Data.},

  abstract = {We describe recent extensions to the Ephyra question answering
(QA) system and their evaluation in the TREC 2007 QA
track. Existing syntactic answer extraction approaches for
factoid and list questions have been complemented with a
high-accuracy semantic approach that generates a semantic
representation of the question and extracts answer candidates
from similar semantic structures in the corpus. Candidates
found by different answer extractors are combined and ranked
by a statistical framework that integrates a variety of answer
validation techniques and similarity measures to estimate a
probability for each candidate. A novel answer type classifier
combines a statistical model and hand-coded rules to predict
the answer type based on syntactic and semantic features
of the question. Our approach for the ‘other’ questions uses
Wikipedia and Google to judge the relevance of answer candidates
found in the corpora.},

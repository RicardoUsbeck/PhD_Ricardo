First, we present detailed evaluation results of AGDISTIS on the RSS 500 and the \url{news.de} datasets varying the depth of the breadth-first-search and the trigram similarity threshold. Note that the accuracy measure is used here, i.e., number of true positives divided by the number of false-positives, see Figures~\ref{fig:RSS500} and \ref{fig:german}.

\end{figure}

Second, we present a comparison on the runtime of AGDISTIS against the state-of-the-art tool AIDA~\cite{AIDA} from March 2013. Especially, AGDISTIS scales well when increasing the number of entities per sentence, see Figure~\ref{fig:runtimeVSentities}.

\end{figure}

Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:agdistis:surfaceforms} depicts the influence of using additional surface forms other than \texttt{rdfs:label}. Using a search depth of two, surface forms increase the F-measure by \~4\%.

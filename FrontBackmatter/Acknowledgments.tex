\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
This thesis has only been possible because of all the people helping, supporting and bearing me.
Thus, this section does not raise any claims on completeness due to the complexity of and duration of this work.
First of all, I would like to thank Majura, my wonderful fiance, she is my girl Friday and provided me with the energy to fulfill my work, even at night.
Next, I owe a shed load of thanks to Axel in his role as being more than a plain supervisor. 
I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Ing. habil. Klaus-Peter F\"ahnrich granting me this opportunity.

Without any particular order I like to thank my colleagues and friends Michael RÃ¶der and Maximilian Speicher for scientific advise, better advices than stakeoverflow and bearing me in the process. 
Professor Lehmann and Auer deserve my respect for the sharing their scientific experience and efficient organization skills. 
I am grateful for all AKSW colleagues for their advice, discussions and provided distractions to survive the PhD process. 
Special thanks goes to my parents Gunter and Bettina for raising me to who I am now.

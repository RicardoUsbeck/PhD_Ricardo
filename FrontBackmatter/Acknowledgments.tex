\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
This thesis has only been possible due to all the people helping, supporting and bearing me.
This section does not raise any claims on completeness due to the complexity of and duration of this work.
First of all, I would like to thank Majura, my wonderful fiancée, she is my girl Friday and provided me with the energy to fulfill my work, even at night.
Next, Axel deserves credit for his role as being more than just a supervisor. 
Of course, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Ing. habil. Klaus-Peter F\"ahnrich for granting me this opportunity.

Without any particular order I like to thank my colleagues and friends Michael Röder and Maximilian Speicher for scientific advise, better advises than \emph{stakeoverflow} and bearing me in the process. 
Professors Lehmann and Auer deserve respect for the sharing their scientific experience and efficient organization skills. 
I am grateful for all AKSW colleagues for their advice, discussions and provided distractions to survive the PhD process. 
Special thanks goes to my parents Gunter and Bettina for raising me to who I am now.

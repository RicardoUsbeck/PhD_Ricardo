I would like to thank


Special thanks goes to my direct supervisor Dr. Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo.
He continuously supported me through my Ph. D. work, gave advice and recommendations for further research steps and improvements.
I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Ing. habil. Klaus-Peter F\"ahnrich for his scientific experience with the efficient organization of the process of a Ph. D. thesis and Prof. Dr. S\"oren Auer who helped me to get a scholarship, which made this thesis possible.   

This thesis was funded by the ESF

I would like to thank Stephan Seeger for providing me with that opportunity.
